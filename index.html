				In 2023, there have been 1,253 deaths in children under 18 across all states, according to Gun Violence Archive. Some states exhibit a higher death rate per capita related to gun violence. Among the top three are Mississippi, Louisiana, and the District of Columbia. According to Marco Castillo, a member of Stop US Arms to Mexico, "The unrestricted proliferation of firearms in the region has been a major factor in violence in the United States."
One significant factor that could influence this trend is the regulations on sale and distribution. Castillo contends, "Faced with a market without rules or limits, US authorities are entirely incapable of preventing these episodes that can result in high numbers of victims."

<p class="intro">
	The state with the highest incidence of gun-related deaths for both adults and children is Mississippi. The state's lenient regulations contribute significantly to the elevated rates of gun violence. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1380025/us-gun-violence-rate-by-state/#:~:text=As%20of%202023%2C%20Mississippi%20was,out%20of%20all%20the%20states/" target="_blank"> Statista's 2023 data </a></li>, Mississippi leads with the highest gun violence rate per 100,000 residents in the United States, standing at 33.9 percent, spanning all age groups. In addition to Mississippi, the District of Columbia also experiences the highest rate of child deaths, emerging as the primary cause of fatality among this demographic.


	When it comes to child safety, states such as Mississippi and Louisiana lack laws addressing child access or secure storage, placing this specific group at risk. These laws play a vital role in mitigating the likelihood of children accessing firearms at home, where they are most vulnerable to accidents. As highlighted by Castillo, " More open violence, more children are likely to die."
